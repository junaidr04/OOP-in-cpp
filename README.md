# OOP in C++ 🚀

Welcome to **OOP in C++**, a collection of Object‑Oriented Programming projects and practice programs written in C++ using core OOP concepts such as:

🔥 Classes & Objects  
🔥 Inheritance  
🔥 Polymorphism  
🔥 Encapsulation  
🔥 Abstraction  

This repository is designed to help learners understand and practice OOP principles with real examples and mini projects.

## 📦 Key Concepts Covered

This repository demonstrates:

- **Classes & Objects** – how real‑world entities are modeled  
- **Inheritance** – shared behavior between related classes  
- **Polymorphism** – using base class pointers for derived objects  
- **Encapsulation** – managing data with private members and public functions  
- **Practical use cases** – real systems like rentals & banking
